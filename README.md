Fashion MNIST Classification with Neural Networks

This project uses a neural network to classify images from the **Fashion MNIST dataset** â€” a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of clothing items like t-shirts, shoes, and bags.

Project Contents

MNIST_fashion.ipynb
  A Jupyter Notebook that:

    Loads and pre-processes the Fashion MNIST dataset
    Trains a binary classification model
    Evaluates the model's performance
    Visualizes predictions alongside the input images

 Features

Neural Network Model built with Keras/TensorFlow
Prediction Visualization :Displays 20 sample images with predicted labels
Binary Classification : Outputs class 0 or 1 based on prediction probability
Uses matplotlib to visualize both the image and predicted result

Dataset

 Source: [Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)
 Each image is:

   Size: 28x28 pixels
   Format: Grayscale
   Labeled with a category such as Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, etc.

Requirements

To run this notebook, you need:


python>=3.7  
tensorflow  
numpy  
matplotlib  


You can install them using pip:

pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib


How to Run

1. Open the notebook: `MNIST_fashion.ipynb`
2. Run all cells in order
3. Check the final section for visual predictions
